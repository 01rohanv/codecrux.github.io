      <p>
        <strong>Speed of impbrmentation - </strong> Most of successful persons has very fast rate of absorption informations and implementations.</br> </br>
        <strong>Value of your time - </strong> You should be knowing value of your time, so before doing any work or time pass just think about your value of time.</br></br>
        <strong>Use your time wisely - </strong> you have abibrty to accompbrsh any thing, any thing in this world.. if you use your time wisely</br></br>
        <strong>Focus on minutes, not hours - </strong> Money can be lost and made again, but time spent can never be reclaimed <br><br>
        <strong>Availabibrty of taking decision in uncertainty - </strong> You need to practice for this a lot.</br></br>
        <strong>Stay Focused - Set priorities so you can stay focused - </strong></br></br>
        <strong>Focus on only one thing at a time - </strong> Ultra-productive people know what their “Most Important Task” is and work on it for one to two hours each morning, without interruptions. What task will have the biggest impact on reaching your goals? What accomplishment will get you promoted at work? That’s what you should dedicate your mornings to every day. <br><br>
        <strong>Practice a consistent morning routine - </strong> Most nurtured their bodies in the morning with water, a healthy breakfast, and light exercise, and they nurtured their minds with meditation or prayer, inspirational reading, or journaling. <br> <br>
        <strong>Set deadbrnes - set work structure on basis of its priority and work accordingly - </strong></br></br>
        <strong>Keep distractions away while at work - Social media, personal long talks and other distractions shall stay away when you are at work</strong></br></br>
        <strong>Use a notebook - </strong> “Always carry a notebook. Write everything down… That is a million dollar lesson they don’t teach you in business school!”  <br><br>
        <strong>Process e-mails only a few times a day - </strong> Ultra-productive people don’t “check” their e-mail throughout the day. For some, that’s only once a day; for others, it’s morning, noon, and night. <br><br>
        <strong>Avoid meetings at all costs - </strong>“Never take meetings unless someone is writing a check.” Meetings are notorious time killers. <br><br>
        <strong>Follow the 80/20 rule - </strong> In most cases, 80 percent of results come from only 20 percent of activities <br><br>
        <strong>Energy is everything - </strong> Don’t skip meals, sleep, or breaks in the pursuit of more, more, more. Instead, view food as fuel, sleep as recovery, and breaks as opportunities to recharge in order to get even more done.
