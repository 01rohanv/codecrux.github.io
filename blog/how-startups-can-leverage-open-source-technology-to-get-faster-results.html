            The study conducted by “Future of Open source” revealed that 90 percent of organisations feel that open source improves efficiency and innovation. The study also mentioned the role of open source in the world of startups and how rapidly it is being adopted. </p>
            <p>If we look closely at the relationship between startups and open source, it is more intertwined than ever before. Startups have been using open source platforms for bringing their ideas into reality, and in turn, they have been giving back to open source by hiring and training developers who have a history of open source contributions.</p>
            <p>
                Open source no more remains a revolution as it was and has become a way of life, especially for the startups. As most of the startups run on limited funds, they prefer the fastest and easiest productive solution, and here is where the open source technology comes to the rescue, as it provides the solution in the most cost economical way, getting them faster results.</p>
            <p>Here are 4 main advantages of the open source technology that will help startups to get faster and better results.</p>




  




        <h3 id="Speed">Speed</h3>
        <p>Like any startup, yours will soon compete for speed, and open source enables speed. One of the main advantages of open source is that it takes the community versions and perceives whether they can solve the business problem or not and starts delivering value right away. With the roots of the community, bugs can be easily detected and get fixed quickly by members of the community.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Flexibility">Flexibility</h3>

        <p>As compared to the proprietary software, where it requires you to upgrade both software and hardware, open source is much less resource intensive. Open source software can be run even on older hardware, and it's entirely up to you when to take it for the upgradation.</p>

       

        <h3 id="Improved-customizability">Improved customizability</h3>

        <p>One of the most attractive advantages of open source is its innate ability to customise your software application. With the open source program, that is entirely customisable, you will have the advantage to personalising your service better. With this, it also opens up your market and puts you at the same level as that of the bigger giants like Microsoft. The customisation is not limited to the initial development but can be continuously done over the time, as the new forms of communication channels emerge and as per your organisational needs. At any time, an open code base allows you to re-outfit the software’s tools and features. You will also be able to create your timelines for innovation.</p>

        

        <h3 id="Cost-effectiveness">Cost-effectiveness</h3>
        <p>Are you nervous? Don’t worry, it’s normal. Remember experts? They’re stressed as well. Everybody has to overcome it. Sometimes it disappears magically after some time. Sometimes you have to do some tricks to overcome it but satisfaction after leaving it behind you is priceless.</p>

        <h3 id="you-learn-a-lot">You learn a lot</h3>
        <p>You raise the bar, learning for yourself is one thing, learning so that other people can benefit changes the game a bit. Don’t be afraid of this effect, no matter how much you learn - you won’t learn <strong>everything</strong>. It’s good to broaden your knowledge but the simple fact of thinking about your audience is enough most of the time.</p>

        <h3 id="stimulating-the-community">Stimulating the community</h3>

        <p>Community is everywhere, I bet it is in your city as well, Speaking at local meetup, local conference is one of the ways to stimulate this community. It gives it opportunity to discuss things, it makes it better.</p>

        <p>You can join ruby confrences, I host one at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/RubyHyderabad/" target="_blank">Ruby Hyderabad</a> also we run a rails network <a href="http://www.railsroot.com/" target="_blank">http://railsroot.com/</a>, which you can join. </p>

        <p>I’m there trying to attend as much as I can, I’d love to listen to you!</p>

        <h3 id="it-all-has-been-presented-already">It all has been presented already</h3>

        <p>Even if it’s true (which it isn’t - it hasn’t been presented yet if it hasn’t been presented <em>by you</em>) - what’s wrong with that? You’re presenting your own view to the particular audience in a particular place at a particular time. It cannot be repeated and you don’t know yet what discussion will you bring after (which can be even more beneficial than the talk itself). You don’t know that before you try.</p>

        <p>Think about your community once again, there’s really a lot of value in doing a talk at local meetup or conference because this is dedication of your time and effort to this group. I will appreciate if you come to my place and talk to me about the stuff you’re interested in. It’ll be more valuable than watching this online and search for <em>the best</em> of the talks on this subject. I’d like to listen to <em>your</em> point of view. I’d like to discuss it <strong>with you and others in this group</strong>.</p>

        <h3 id="what-am-i-doing-among-all-these-men">What am I doing among all these men?</h3>

        <p>Women - you’re still underrepresented in our industry. It doesn’t mean you have to be underrepresented at local meetups or conferences. It’ll be great to listen to you!</p>

        <p>Try out conferences too, I’ve been to many - they’re full of great people and the atmosphere can be really amazing. Don’t hesitate to send your proposals to conference “Call For Papers”.</p>

        <p>Men - if you have girl friend who is reluctant to speak in public - please tell her that you’d like to listen to her, let us be at least two wanting more women at meetups and conferences!</p>

        <h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
        <p>You have to spend a lot of hours in preparation and practice. There’s no other way but it pays off. There is a significant difference between speakers preparing for the talk and those who treat it a bit lightly. There are very few speakers with such an enormous talent they don’t have to prepare. Most of the brilliant talks I’ve listened to were the result of practicing… a lot!</p>

        <h3 id="its-time-for-you">It’s time for You</h3>

        <p>Now it’s time for you so <strong>go ahead</strong> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/RubyHyderabad/" target="_blank">submit your proposals</a>!</p>

        <p>Hopefully see you there!</p>
