            <p> Development of the Android app is performed in bits  as per the features added to the app. And here’s where you get the advantage of a flexible environment at CodeCrux, providing you with space and control to review the development process and also considering the required changes that you really want in the app.</p>

            <p> For us at CodeCrux, quality matters the most, and that’s why the quality assurance team takes the maximum effort and care to test each and every bit after the development is over. And then for the Beta Version, once again the team looks at it when all the features and functionalities have been integrated into the app. Once we are assured of things to be smooth, we deploy/launch the app in the App store or can also guide you through with everything so that you can do it yourself.</p>
