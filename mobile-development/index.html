          <p>
            We have been building products in Ruby on Rails for 7+ years. Rails is a flexible framework that allows rapid prototyping and has a large community of developers commited to contributing to the Ruby on Rails open source community.
          <br>
          <p>
            Our team loves Ruby on Rails development because of the speed of development and ecosystem of products around it including Heroku for hosting, New Relic for monitoring and many more.

            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>
              Our design and development teams will work with you to thoroughly understand your business objectives. Once they understand your vision for the app, they will merge their deep knowledge of all things android and your vision to develop an initial concept for the app.

            <h4>Features & Architecture</h4>
            <p>
              Next the team will determine the features that need to be added and build an app architecture that efficiently integrates all the features. In short, our awesome developers will figure out the kinks to create a smooth framework.

            <p>
              Our designers believe “Design is King”. Our design and development teams will create a stunning, captivating design for your app without compromising the integrity and performance of the architecture.

            <p>
              The Android app development is done in bits (thus, CodeCrux!) according to the features added in the app. Our Agile-based work environment will give you the control to review our development process and demand any changes you may want.

          <div class="app-process-step">
            <h4>QA & Deployment</h4>
            <p>
              Our Quality Assurance team will test each bit after development and then, again when all the features and functionalities have been integrated into the app as a Beta Version. Once assured, we can deploy/launch the app in the App Store or arm you with everything you will need to do it yourself.
