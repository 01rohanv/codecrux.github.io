                  Mytonomy is a near-peer social network designed to bring alumni advice to high school students while supporting the overburdened high school counselor. We help young people from age 14–25, make better decisions about big life choices: how to go to college and pay for it, where to apply, what to study, and how to link all of that to an eventual career.
