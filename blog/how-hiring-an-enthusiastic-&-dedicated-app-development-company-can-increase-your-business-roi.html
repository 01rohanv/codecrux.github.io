            <p><strong><h3>Here are top 5 reasons that will justify why one should invest in a dedicated app development team to increase their business ROI.&nbsp;</strong></h3></p>
            <p>Quick Answer</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Strengthens your company’s ecosystem</li>
                <li>The substantial limitations on AWS EC2 network throughput must be taken into consideration when designing high-speed data processing systems.</li>
                <li>Google's unique multi-region buckets keep costs down when working with data from multiple datacenters in the same region (e.g. continent).</li>
                <li>Object storage scales automatically to provide high aggregate throughput.</li>
                <li>Finally, note that I’m only showing data from API access (which is the exact same boto code for AWS and Google), and I have unsurprisingly observed substantial differences in performance from different clients (the vendor-specific CLIs,
                    node.js API package, cURL’ing URLs, etc.)</li>
            </ol>
