          <p>
            We have been building products in Ruby on Rails for 7+ years. Rails is a flexible framework that allows rapid prototyping and has a large community of developers commited to contributing to the Ruby on Rails open source community.
          <br>
          <p>
            Our team loves Ruby on Rails development because of the speed of development and ecosystem of products around it including Heroku for hosting, New Relic for monitoring and many more.
