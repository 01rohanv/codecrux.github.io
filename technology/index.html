            <h4>About Ruby</h4>



              <div id="content">
                <p class="summary">Wondering why Ruby is so popular? Its fans call it a beautiful, artful
            language. And yet, they say it’s handy and practical. What gives?</p>

            <h4>The Ideals of Ruby’s Creator</h4>

            <p>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Yukihiro “Matz”
            Matsumoto</a>, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk,
            Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional
            programming with imperative programming.</p>

            <p>He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,”
            in a way that mirrors life.</p>

            <p>Building on this, he adds:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like
            our human body<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h4>About Ruby’s Growth</h4>

            <p>Since its public release in 1995, Ruby has drawn devoted coders
            worldwide. In 2006, Ruby achieved mass acceptance. With active user
            groups formed in the world’s major cities and Ruby-related conferences
            filled to capacity.</p>

            <p>Ruby-Talk, the primary <a href="/en/community/mailing-lists/">mailing list</a> for
            discussion of the Ruby language, climbed to an average of 200 messages
            per day in 2006. It has dropped in recent years as the size of the
            community pushed discussion from one central list into many smaller
            groups.</p>

            <p>Ruby is ranked among the top 10 on most of the indices that measure
            the growth and popularity of programming languages worldwide
            (such as the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE index</a>). Much of the growth is attributed to the
            popularity of software written in Ruby, particularly the
            <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> web framework.</p>

            <p>Ruby is also <a href="/en/about/license.txt">completely free</a>. Not only free of charge, but
            also free to use, copy, modify, and distribute.</p>

            <h4>Seeing Everything as an Object</h4>

            <p>Initially, Matz looked at other languages to find an ideal syntax.
            Recalling his search, he said, “I wanted a scripting language that was
            more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than
            Python<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>.”</p>

            <p>In Ruby, everything is an object. Every bit of information and code can
            be given their own properties and actions. Object-oriented programming
            calls properties by the name <em>instance variables</em> and actions are known
            as <em>methods</em>. Ruby’s pure object-oriented approach is most commonly
            demonstrated by a bit of code which applies an action to a number.</p>

            <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">times</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"We *love* Ruby -- it's outrageous!"</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

            <p>In many languages, numbers and other primitive types are not objects.
            Ruby follows the influence of the Smalltalk language by giving methods
            and instance variables to all of its types. This eases one’s use of
            Ruby, since rules applying to objects apply to all of Ruby.</p>

            <h4>Ruby’s Flexibility</h4>

            <p>Ruby is seen as a flexible language, since it allows its users to freely
            alter its parts. Essential parts of Ruby can be removed or redefined, at
            will. Existing parts can be added upon. Ruby tries not to restrict the
            coder.</p>

            <p>For example, addition is performed with the plus (<code>+</code>) operator. But, if
            you’d rather use the readable word <code>plus</code>, you could add such a method
            to Ruby’s builtin <code>Numeric</code> class.</p>

            <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Numeric</span>
              <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">plus</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
                <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">+</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
              <span class="k">end</span>
            <span class="k">end</span>

            <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">plus</span> <span class="mi">6</span>
            <span class="c1"># y is now equal to 11</span></code></pre></figure>

            <p>Ruby’s operators are syntactic sugar for methods. You can redefine them
            as well.</p>

            <h4>Blocks: a Truly Expressive Feature</h4>

            <p>Ruby’s block are also seen as a source of great flexibility. A
            programmer can attach a closure to any method, describing how that
            method should act. The closure is called a <em>block</em> and has become one of
            the most popular features for newcomers to Ruby from other imperative
            languages like PHP or Visual Basic.</p>

            <p>Blocks are inspired by functional languages. Matz said, “in Ruby
            closures, I wanted to respect the Lisp culture<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.”</p>

            <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">search_engines</span> <span class="o">=</span>
              <span class="sx">%w[Google Yahoo MSN]</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">engine</span><span class="o">|</span>
                <span class="s2">"http://www."</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">engine</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">downcase</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">".com"</span>
              <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

            <p>In the above code, the block is described inside the <code>do ... end</code>
            construct. The <code>map</code> method applies the block to the provided list of
            words. Many other methods in Ruby leave a hole open for a coder to write
            their own block to fill in the details of what that method should do.</p>

            <h4>Ruby and the Mixin</h4>

            <p>Unlike many object-oriented languages, Ruby features single inheritance
            only, <strong>on purpose</strong>. But Ruby knows the concept of modules (called
            Categories in Objective-C). Modules are collections of methods.</p>

            <p>Classes can mixin a module and receive all its methods for free. For
            example, any class which implements the <code>each</code> method can mixin the
            <code>Enumerable</code> module, which adds a pile of methods that use <code>each</code> for
            looping.</p>

            <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyArray</span>
              <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Enumerable</span>
            <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

            <p>Generally, Rubyists see this as a much clearer way than multiple
            inheritance, which is complex and can be too restrictive.</p>

            <h4>Ruby’s Visual Appearance</h4>

            <p>While Ruby often uses very limited punctuation and usually prefers
            English keywords, some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby. Ruby needs
            no variable declarations. It uses simple naming conventions to denote
            the scope of variables.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><code>var</code> could be a local variable.</li>
              <li><code>@var</code> is an instance variable.</li>
              <li><code>$var</code> is a global variable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These sigils enhance readability by allowing the programmer to easily
            identify the roles of each variable. It also becomes unnecessary to use
            a tiresome <code>self.</code> prepended to every instance member.</p>

            <h4>Beyond the Basics</h4>

            <p>Ruby has a wealth of other features, among which are the following:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Ruby has exception handling features, like Java or Python, to make it
            easy to handle errors.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ruby features a true mark-and-sweep garbage collector for all Ruby
            objects. No need to maintain reference counts in extension libraries.
            As Matz says, “This is better for your health.”</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Writing C extensions in Ruby is easier than in Perl or Python, with a
            very elegant API for calling Ruby from C. This includes calls for
            embedding Ruby in software, for use as a scripting language. A SWIG
            interface is also available.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ruby can load extension libraries dynamically if an OS allows.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ruby features OS independent threading. Thus, for all platforms on
            which Ruby runs, you also have multithreading, regardless of if the OS
            supports it or not, even on MS-DOS!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ruby is highly portable: it is developed mostly on GNU/Linux, but
            works on many types of UNIX, Mac OS X, Windows, DOS, BeOS, OS/2, etc.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Other Implementations of Ruby</h4>

            <p>Ruby, as a language, has a few different implementations.
            This page has been discussing the reference implementation, in the
            community often referred to as <strong>MRI</strong> (“Matz’s Ruby Interpreter”)
            or <strong>CRuby</strong> (since it is written in C), but there are also others.
            They are often useful in certain situations, provide extra
            integration to other languages or environments, or have special features
            that MRI doesn’t.</p>

            <p>Here’s a list:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby</a> is Ruby atop the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), utilizing the
            JVM’s optimizing JIT compilers, garbage collectors, concurrent
            threads, tool ecosystem, and vast collection of libraries.</li>
              <li><a href="http://rubini.us">Rubinius</a> is ‘Ruby written in Ruby’. Built on top of LLVM,
            Rubinius sports a nifty virtual machine that other languages are being

              <li><a href="http://www.macruby.org">MacRuby</a> is a Ruby that’s tightly integrated with Apple’s Cocoa
            libraries for Mac OS X, allowing you to write desktop applications

            <h4>What Is DevOps?<h4>
            <p>DevOps is a term for a group of concepts that, while not all new, have catalyzed into a movement and are rapidly spreading throughout the technical community.  Like any new and popular term, people have somewhat confused and sometimes contradictory impressions of what it is.  Here’s my take on how DevOps can be usefully defined; I propose this definition as a standard framework to more clearly discuss the various issues DevOps covers. Like “Quality” or “Agile,” DevOps is a large enough concept that it requires some nuance to fully understand</p>
            <h4>Definition of DevOps</h4>
            <p>DevOps is a new term emerging from the collision of two major related trends. The first was also&nbsp;called “agile system administration” or “agile operations”; it sprang from applying&nbsp;newer Agile and Lean approaches to operations work.&nbsp; The second is a much expanded understanding of the value of collaboration between development and operations staff throughout all stages of the development lifecycle when creating and operating a&nbsp;service, and how important operations has become in our increasingly service-oriented world (cf. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2006/07/operations-the-new-secret-sauc.html">Operations: The New Secret Sauce</a>).</p>

            <br>
            <div ng-hide="loading" ng-include="partialPath" autoscroll="" class="ng-scope">

            <h4 id="what-is-angular-" class="ng-scope">What Is Angular?</h4>
            <p class="ng-scope">AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template
            language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and
            succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you
            would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it
            an ideal partner with any server technology.</p>
            <p class="ng-scope">Angular is what HTML would have been, had it been designed for applications. HTML is a great
            declarative language for static documents. It does not contain much in the way of creating
            applications, and as a result building web applications is an exercise in <em>what do I have to do
            to trick the browser into doing what I want?</em></p>
            <p class="ng-scope">The impedance mismatch between dynamic applications and static documents is often solved with:</p>
            <ul class="ng-scope">
            <li><strong>a library</strong> - a collection of functions which are useful when writing web apps. Your code is
            in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit. E.g., <code><span class="pln">jQuery</span></code>.</li>
            <li><strong>frameworks</strong> - a particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in
            the details. The framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it needs something
            app specific. E.g., <code><span class="pln">durandal</span></code>, <code><span class="pln">ember</span></code>, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ng-scope">Angular takes another approach. It attempts to minimize the impedance mismatch between document
            centric HTML and what an application needs by creating new HTML constructs. Angular teaches the
            browser new syntax through a construct we call <em>directives</em>. Examples include:</p>
            <ul class="ng-scope">
            <li>Data binding, as in <code><span class="pun">{{}}</span></code>.</li>
            <li>DOM control structures for repeating, showing and hiding DOM fragments.</li>
            <li>Support for forms and form validation.</li>
            <li>Attaching new behavior to DOM elements, such as DOM event handling.</li>
            <li>Grouping of HTML into reusable components.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="a-complete-client-side-solution" class="ng-scope">A complete client-side solution</h4>
            <p class="ng-scope">Angular is not a single piece in the overall puzzle of building the client-side of a web
            application. It handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a
            well-defined structure. This makes Angular opinionated about how a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
            application should be built. But while it is opinionated, it also tries to make sure that its opinion
            is just a starting point you can easily change. Angular comes with the following out-of-the-box:</p>
            <ul class="ng-scope">
            <li>Everything you need to build a CRUD app in a cohesive set: Data-binding, basic templating
            directives, form validation, routing, deep-linking, reusable components and dependency injection.</li>
            <li>Testability story: Unit-testing, end-to-end testing, mocks and test harnesses.</li>
            <li>Seed application with directory layout and test scripts as a starting point.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="angular-s-sweet-spot" class="ng-scope">Angular's sweet spot</h4>
            <p class="ng-scope">Angular simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the
            developer. Like any abstraction, it comes at a cost of flexibility. In other words, not every app
            is a good fit for Angular. Angular was built with the CRUD application in mind. Luckily CRUD
            applications represent the majority of web applications. To understand what Angular is
            good at, though, it helps to understand when an app is not a good fit for Angular.</p>
            <p class="ng-scope">Games and GUI editors are examples of applications with intensive and tricky DOM manipulation.
            These kinds of apps are different from CRUD apps, and as a result are probably not a good fit for Angular.
            In these cases it may be better to use a library with a lower level of abstraction, such as <code><span class="pln">jQuery</span></code>.</p>
            <h4 id="the-zen-of-angular" class="ng-scope">The Zen of Angular</h4>
            <p class="ng-scope">Angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes
            to building UIs and wiring software components together, while imperative code is excellent for
            expressing business logic.</p>
            <ul class="ng-scope">
            <li>It is a very good idea to decouple DOM manipulation from app logic. This dramatically improves
            the testability of the code.</li>
            <li>It is a really, <em>really</em> good idea to regard app testing as equal in importance to app
            writing. Testing difficulty is dramatically affected by the way the code is structured.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent idea to decouple the client side of an app from the server side. This
            allows development work to progress in parallel, and allows for reuse of both sides.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful indeed if the framework guides developers through the entire journey of
            building an app: From designing the UI, through writing the business logic, to testing.</li>
            <li>It is always good to make common tasks trivial and difficult tasks possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ng-scope">Angular frees you from the following pains:</p>
            <ul class="ng-scope">
            <li><strong>Registering callbacks:</strong> Registering callbacks clutters your code, making it hard to see the
            forest for the trees. Removing common boilerplate code such as callbacks is a good thing. It
            vastly reduces the amount of JavaScript coding <em>you</em> have to do, and it makes it easier to see
            what your application does.</li>
            <li><strong>Manipulating HTML DOM programmatically:</strong> Manipulating HTML DOM is a cornerstone of AJAX
            applications, but it's cumbersome and error-prone. By declaratively describing how the UI
            should change as your application state changes, you are freed from low-level DOM manipulation
            tasks. Most applications written with Angular never have to programmatically manipulate the
            DOM, although you can if you want to.</li>
            <li><strong>Marshaling data to and from the UI:</strong> CRUD operations make up the majority of AJAX
            applications' tasks. The flow of marshaling data from the server to an internal object to an HTML
            form, allowing users to modify the form, validating the form, displaying validation errors,
            returning to an internal model, and then back to the server, creates a lot of boilerplate
            code. Angular eliminates almost all of this boilerplate, leaving code that describes the
            overall flow of the application rather than all of the implementation details.</li>
            <li><strong>Writing tons of initialization code just to get started:</strong> Typically you need to write a lot
            of plumbing just to get a basic "Hello World" AJAX app working. With Angular you can bootstrap
            your app easily using services, which are auto-injected into your application in a
            <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a>-like dependency-injection style. This allows you
            to get started developing features quickly. As a bonus, you get full control over the
            initialization process in automated tests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

            <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.</p>
