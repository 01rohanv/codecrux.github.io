      <h1>Creating Post FilesPermalink</h1>
      <p>
        To create a new post, all you need to do is create a file in the _posts directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

        YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
        Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

        2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
        2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md

      </p>
      <blockquote><p><strong>“Write today, for future.”</strong></p></blockquote>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-html" data-lang="html">
        </code>
      </pre>
