          Creating Post FilesPermalink
          To create a new post, all you need to do is create a file in the _posts directory. How you name files in this folder is important. Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:
          YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
          Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and MARKUP is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:
          2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
          2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
        </p>
